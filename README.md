# Toolkit

The Transforming Publishing team have created a toolkit of templates, guides and resources to support the modernisation of both the back end production of statistical products ([Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](#reproducible-analytical-pipelines)) and the user-facing output of statistical products to a digital platform ([Transformed Publications](#transformed-publications)). These tools will also be helpful when moving from a proprietary software such as SPSS or SAS, to an open source software such as R for any statistical analyses. 

## Reproducible Analytical Pipelines
Reproducible Analytical Pipelines are a way to introduce a robust, efficient and reproducible work flow when carrying out data analysis. They have traditionally been applied to statistical publications, but the 

- [**This paper**](https://www.isdscotland.org/About-ISD/Methodologies/_docs/Reproducible_Analytical_Pipelines_paper_v1.4.pdf) explains what Reproducible Analytical Pipelines are, how to assess whether your work is suitable to ‘RAP’ and details several levels of code maturity and RAP which can be selected depending on a number of factors, such as the skill in your team or the available IT infrastructure.
- The [**PHI R Style Guide**](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/R-Resources/blob/master/PHI%20R%20style%20guide.md) should be used by analysts when writing R code to improve consistency across the organisation and ensure that our R code is readable, shareable and reusable. 
- Use this [**blank R project template**](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/r-project-structure) when starting new R code to ensure you have a sensible workflow and structure. Coming soon: a package which allows you to create projects with this structure from within RStudio.
- [**This app**](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/nhs-r-resources/) contains a range of resources for R, such as links to online training and cheatsheets, and information about internal R user groups.
- The Transforming Publishing team also have a [**resources area**](https://github.com/NHS-NSS-transforming-publications/resources), with useful resources on technical issues such as version control.
- If using git, you may like to follow our team's [**GitHub guidance**](https://github.com/NHS-NSS-transforming-publications/GitHub-guidance) on workflow and security.
- We have developed [**National Statistic publication templates**](https://github.com/NHS-NSS-transforming-publications/RMarkdown) in Rmarkdown, to help the automation of PDF reporting.
